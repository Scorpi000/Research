    "# 协整（Cointegration）\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of cointegration can be generalized to systems of higher-order variables if a linear combination reduces their common order of integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cointegration is distinguished from traditional economic equilibrium, in which a balance of forces produces stable long-term levels in the variables. Cointegrated variables are generally unstable in their levels, but exhibit mean-reverting “spreads” (generalized by the cointegrating relation) that force the variables to move around common stochastic trends. Cointegration is also distinguished from the short-term synchronies of positive covariance, which only measures the tendency to move together at each time step. Modification of the VAR model to include cointegrated variables balances the short-term dynamics of the system with long-term tendencies. The tendency of cointegrated variables to revert to common stochastic trends is expressed in terms of error-correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration and cointegration both present opportunities for transforming variables to stationarity. Integrated variables, identified by unit root and stationarity tests, can be differenced to stationarity. Cointegrated variables, identified by cointegration tests, can be combined to form new, stationary variables. In practice, it must be determined if such transformations lead to more reliable models, with variables that retain an economic interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizing from the univariate case can be misleading. In the standard Box-Jenkins approach to univariate ARMA modeling, stationarity is an essential assumption. Without it, the underlying distribution theory and estimation techniques become invalid. In the corresponding multivariate case, where the VAR model is unrestricted and there is no cointegration, choices are less straightforward. If the goal of a VAR analysis is to determine relationships among the original variables, differencing loses information. In this context, Sims, Stock, and Watson  advise against differencing, even in the presence of unit roots. If, however, the goal is to simulate an underlying data-generating process, integrated levels data can cause a number of problems. Model specification tests lose power due to an increase in the number of estimated parameters. Other tests, such as those for Granger causality, no longer have standard distributions, and become invalid. Finally, forecasts over long time horizons suffer from inconsistent estimates, due to impulse responses that do not decay. Enders discusses modeling strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of cointegration, simple differencing is a model misspecification, since long-term information appears in the levels. Fortunately, the cointegrated VAR model provides intermediate options, between differences and levels, by mixing them together with the cointegrating relations. Since all terms of the cointegrated VAR model are stationary, problems with unit roots are eliminated."

    "Cointegration modeling is often suggested, independently, by economic theory. Examples of variables that are commonly described with a cointegrated VAR model include:\n",
    "* Money stock, interest rates, income, and prices (common models of money demand)\n",
    "* Investment, income, and consumption (common models of productivity)\n",
    "* Consumption and long-term income expectation (Permanent Income Hypothesis)\n",
    "* Exchange rates and prices in foreign and domestic markets (Purchasing Power Parity)\n",
    "* Spot and forward currency exchange rates and interest rates (Covered Interest Rate Parity)\n",
    "* Interest rates of different maturities (Term Structure Expectations Hypothesis)\n",
    "* Interest rates and inflation (Fisher Equation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these theories describe long-term equilibria among the variables, accurate estimation of cointegrated models may require large amounts of low-frequency (annual, quarterly, monthly) macroeconomic data. As a result, these models must consider the possibility of structural changes in the underlying data-generating process during the sample period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial data, by contrast, is often available at high frequencies (hours, minutes, microseconds). The mean-reverting spreads of cointegrated financial series can be modeled and examined for arbitrage opportunities. For example, the Law of One Price suggests cointegration among the following groups of variables:\n",
    "* Prices of assets with identical cash flows\n",
    "* Prices of assets and dividends\n",
    "* Spot, future, and forward prices\n",
    "* Bid and ask prices"
